GEONOVO is an interactive website where users can add some of their favorite locations around their city.

TECH:
The frontend of GEONOVO uses react to render an easy and interactive user interface.

Geonovo uses a mysql database to save information such as the users, markers around the city, and the user's favorite markers.

On the backend Geonovo uses express to create the server and make the necessary requests to provide a fully functioning interface.


USER GUIDE:

When the page loads the user will see our homepage with an interactive map of the city of New Orleans. From there the user should find a navigation bar located above the map.

If the user is new to the site, they should venture over to our register page via the link in the navigation bar to create an account.

If the user already has an account they can also find our login page in our navigation bar. After the user had logged in or registered, they will be able to then search the city for interesting or cool spots indicated by a marker on the map.

When clicked, the marker will pop up and display an image, description, a favorite button inicated by a heart, and a comment box where the user can leave a comment on a marker.

The user can also contribute their own markers to the map! Simply click the ADD & DRAG button, place a marker on the location that you find interesting, then click the add pin button. From there you can give the marker a description, and even upload your own photo to the marker. Find your way back to the home screen and you'll be able to see your marker on the map!
